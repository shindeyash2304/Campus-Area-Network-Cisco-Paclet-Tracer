## Overview
This project involves analyzing and mapping the network topology of a campus area network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It also includes an attack surface mapping exercise and a security assessment report.

## Project Structure
- `Network_Topology/`: Contains the network topology files, including the Cisco Packet Tracer file and diagrams.
- `Attack_Surface_Mapping/`: Includes documents related to the attack surface mapping.
- `Security_Assessment_Report/`: Final security assessment report and countermeasures.

## How to Use
- Open the `.pkt` file in the `Network_Topology/` folder using Cisco Packet Tracer to view the network topology.
- Review the security assessment report in the `Security_Assessment_Report/` folder for detailed analysis and recommendations.
